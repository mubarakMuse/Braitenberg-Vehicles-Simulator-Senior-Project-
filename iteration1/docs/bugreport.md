### Robot Simulator Iteration 1 Bug Report

#### robot: 1) get stuck to the base sometimes if i make it stop 2) clamped not implemented so the robot spins very fast

#### obstacle: 1) bounce of the wall a lot sometimes and doesn't see to escape it at times.

#### entity_factory: 1) it seems that entities are randomly positioned after the second time, they usually start at the same spot first time the game is run. 2) the random positioning function doesn't do a good job making sure they don't overlap at the beginning of the game. 3) that function also might position some entities outside the arena(very rare).
