The Progam is a video game in which a user controls the robot with the arrow keys. The objective of the game is to touch all of the bases without running into obstacles or walls. The robot is given a fixed number of nine lives at the beginning of the game, but it will lose a life with every collision (except for when colliding with a base).\hypertarget{index_Win_loss}{}\section{Win\+\_\+loss}\label{index_Win_loss}
The Program determines is the robot has won or losses, it calls a function after each collision to see whether all the bases have been captured or if the lives of the robot are zero or less. If one of those is true and then changes the game status accordingly. the game has been won all entites turn red and if the robot looses than it all turns purple.
